# App Store Connect – Assets Checklist

Use this before uploading to App Store Connect so nothing is missing.

## App Icon (required)

| Asset | Location | Requirement |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **App Icon** | `SuperBowlBox/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` | One image: **1024×1024 px** PNG, no transparency, sRGB. File: `AppIcon-1024.png`. |

- Xcode generates all device sizes from this single image.
- The catalog is set to **iOS only** (no Mac slots), so no missing-icon warnings when building for iPhone/iPad.

## In-app logo

| Asset | Location | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **SquareUp logo** | `SuperBowlBox/Resources/Assets.xcassets/SquareUpLogo.imageset/` | Splash screen, onboarding, Settings “About”, nav. |

- Image set has 1x, 2x, 3x (all reference the same source for scaling).
- If you have a dedicated **logo** (not the app icon), add a PNG to this imageset and name it in `Contents.json` (e.g. `SquareUpLogo.png`). Otherwise the current file is used for both icon and in-app logo.

## Before you push

1. **App Icon**
   - [ ] `AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-1024.png` exists and is **1024×1024**.
   - [ ] PNG, no alpha, square.

2. **Archive**
   - [ ] In Xcode: **Product → Archive**.
   - [ ] No asset catalog warnings (missing images).

3. **App Store Connect**
   - [ ] **App Information** → **Name**: Set to **"Square Up"** (this is the name shown in the App Store; the app’s home-screen name is set by `CFBundleDisplayName` in the project).
   - [ ] Subtitle, category, and other metadata as needed.
   - [ ] **Screenshots**: Add for required device sizes (e.g. 6.7", 6.5", 5.5").
   - [ ] **App Icon**: Picked up from the build; no separate upload if using asset catalog.

4. **Optional**
   - [ ] Separate **SquareUpLogo** image in `SquareUpLogo.imageset/` if the in-app logo should differ from the app icon.

## Sizes reference

| Context | Size |
|---------|------|
| App Store / submission | 1024×1024 |
| iPhone (home screen) | 180×180 (@3x) |
| iPad (home screen) | 167×167 (@2x) |

All derived sizes are generated by Xcode from the 1024×1024 icon.
