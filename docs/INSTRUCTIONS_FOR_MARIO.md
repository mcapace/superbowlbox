# Instructions for Mario (Counsel)

**From:** [Your name]  
**Re:** Square Up — P2P gaming app; legal brief + TestFlight access

---

I thought of you for this. I’d love your honest take: in your view, does this have any legs, or is it a non-starter? With your expertise it could be something cool to work through together—and if you think it’s a waste of time, I respect that and your expertise either way.

---

## What you’re getting

- **GitHub (Git) access** — so you can view and download the legal brief and docs.
- **TestFlight access** — so you can install and try the Square Up app on your iPhone (optional).

You only need GitHub to read the brief. TestFlight is optional if you want to see the app.

# Part A: How to access GitHub (Git) and get the brief

## Rules for GitHub access

1. **You need a GitHub account.** If you don’t have one: go to [github.com](https://github.com), click **Sign up**, and create a free account (use the same email I’ll use to invite you).
2. **I will add you to the repo.** I’ll send an invite to your email. You must **accept the invite** or you won’t be able to open the repo or download files.
3. **Repo link (after you accept):**  
   [https://github.com/mcapace/superbowlbox](https://github.com/mcapace/superbowlbox)

## What you need to do (GitHub)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Check your email for an invite from **GitHub** to join the **superbowlbox** repository. |
| 2 | Click **Accept invitation** (or the link in the email). Log in to GitHub if asked. |
| 3 | Open the repo: [https://github.com/mcapace/superbowlbox](https://github.com/mcapace/superbowlbox) |
| 4 | Click the **docs** folder. |
| 5 | **Main doc (everything in one place):** Click **MARIO_FULL_PACK.md** to read the legal brief, codebase overview, schemas, and app flow on GitHub (or click **Raw** → Save As to download). |
| 6 | (Optional) For a PDF of the brief: **MARIO_LEGAL_BRIEF_P2P_GAMING.pdf**. For a one-page summary: **MARIO_ONE_PAGER.pdf**. |

**If you prefer the brief with flowcharts in a browser:** In **docs**, click **MARIO_LEGAL_BRIEF_P2P_GAMING.html** → **Download** → open the downloaded file in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.

**You do not need to install Git on your computer.** Using the GitHub website and the **docs** folder is enough.

# Part B: How to access TestFlight and try the app

## Rules for TestFlight access

1. **You need an iPhone** with your Apple ID signed in.
2. **I need your Apple ID email** (the one you use for the App Store / iCloud). I’ll add that email in App Store Connect so you get the TestFlight invite.
3. **You will get an email from Apple** (not from me) with a link to install the app. You must use that link on your iPhone.
4. **The first time you use TestFlight**, you may need to install the **TestFlight** app from the App Store (free, from Apple). After that, TestFlight invites open in that app.

## What you need to do (TestFlight)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Send me the **email address tied to your Apple ID** (so I can add you as a tester). |
| 2 | Check that email for an invite from **Apple** or **TestFlight** to test **Square Up**. |
| 3 | On your **iPhone**, open the invite (tap the link in the email). If you don’t have the TestFlight app, install it from the App Store when prompted. |
| 4 | In TestFlight, tap **Accept** (or **Install**) for Square Up. The app will install on your home screen. |
| 5 | Open **Square Up** and tap around if you want (e.g. create a pool, join with a code). This is optional—the legal review is based on the brief, not on using the app. |

**If you don’t get the TestFlight email:** Check spam/junk. If it’s not there after 24 hours, tell me and I’ll resend the invite or double-check the email I used.

**You do not need a paid Apple Developer account.** TestFlight is free for testers.

# Part C: What I’m asking from you

- **Read the brief** (in **MARIO_FULL_PACK.md** or the PDF from **docs**) when you have time. The full pack includes a **codebase overview** (repo layout, where pool/auth/backend code lives) so you can tie the P2P model to the implementation.
- **Your honest opinion:** Does this have legs in your view, or is it a dead end? I’d rather hear it straight.
- **Questions for you** are in Section 5 of the brief (P2P vs. gambling regulation, state/jurisdiction, risk mitigation, etc.).
- **Next step:** A short call to walk through the model and your take, then we can decide on any follow-up (e.g. formal opinion, state-by-state review).
