# Square Up — One-Page Overview for Counsel (Mario)

**What it is:** A mobile app where people **create** or **join** pool games (e.g. Super Bowl squares). All custom code; no third-party betting apps or bookmaker integration.

**How it’s different:**

| | **Kalshi / Polymarket** | **Sportsbooks** | **Square Up** |
|---|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Who sets “the bet”? | Platform / market | Bookmaker | **Users** (pool creator) |
| House / platform takes a cut? | Often yes | Yes (vig) | **No** |
| Money flow | Platform / counterparty | House ↔ bettor | **User ↔ user** (P2P) |
| Access | Open markets | Open odds | **Invite code only** |

**Core idea:** “Gaming your way” — users define the pool and rules; the app is a **tool** to create, share (invite code), and resolve. No oddsmaker, no house, no platform-held funds.

**Ask for counsel:** Does this **P2P, no-house** model raise different (or lower) regulatory risk than prediction markets or sportsbooks? What guardrails do you recommend before scaling?
